<h1>An Interactive Tool for Visualizing Statewide Transit-Based Land Use Policy</h1>

		<div id="explainer">
			<p>SB 50 would bring sweeping changes to areas close to some public transit stops in California. However, areas that are determined to be in "sensitive communities" are able to opt into a community planning effort that would provide these communities with greater autonomy in terms of where and how increased residential density is achieved.</p>

			<p>The requirements for which areas qualify as "sensitive communities" have changed over the course of the bill. This tool allows users to view multiple possible definitions of "sensitive communities" and observe how those definitions would change the eligible areas for the bill.</p>
